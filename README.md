# bonpsi
Repository for storing scripts/documentation using OpenEphys Bonsai video capture tool across multiple boxes.

This is named bonpsi (pronounced the same way as Bonsai) because @anoushehbsuroosh introduced the use of [Bonsai](https://open-ephys.org/bonsai) for recording videos obtained through MedPC boxes. Her project studies the effects of psilocybin. I thought that was funny.

You can check out a Bonsai methods paper [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2021.647640/full). Bonsai is written by [Gon√ßalo Lopes](https://twitter.com/glopesdev) at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown. 

Anousheh has some documentation coming in the near future, but here's some general advice she offered:
- Install every native Bonsai package
- Install video libraries (2-3)
- Install windows input library
